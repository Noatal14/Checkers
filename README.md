# React Checkers
Checkers game made with React/JS.

# Code
* The project was started using the NPM create-react-app
* Checkers game logic is in src/Game.js
* Pieces for both players are stored as the values in the board matrix. Example: the value of boardState[0][0] starts the game as a white piece object. When the piece moves, the value at boardState[0][0] will be null.
